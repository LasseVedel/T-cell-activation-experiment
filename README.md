# T-cell-activation-experiment

This repository contains the code and data used for creating the "T cell activation and transduction" shiny application. 
The app can be used to visualize and understand gene expression data from an experiment, in which T cells were activated and transduced a LV-VSV.G carrying a CAR-transgene at different timepoints. 
The app is hosted at Heroku.
